Some files backing my bulletin board system running Wildcat! 4.20 ML10
on MS-DOS, TuxedoCat Lounge BBS

### Wildcat! batch files

Various DOS batch files for starting BBS nodes, door programs, maintenance,
backup, and other tasks

### Netfoss files

FOSSIL driver interfacing with modems and telnet server

### UUCP / wcGate files

The BBS has Internet e-mail support by dialing out to a Raspberry Pi
and performing a UUCP transfer.

These are the files on the Wildcat! side of things.
